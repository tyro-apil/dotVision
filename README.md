# Refreshable Braille Display: Team Dot Vision

## Problem Statement

About only 1% of published books are designed for visually impaired people. And, within those specific books, only a few percent is in Braille. This fact was a light bulb moment for us to design a refreshable braille display to accomodate literary activities for visually impaired.

## Our idea

We thought of making a full-size braille display of multiple rows along with navigation features like Next and Previous buttons. Due to time constraint in the hackathon, we proceeded with implementing a single braille cell.
